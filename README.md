# real-time-payment-scoring
The goal of this project is to build a real-time payment scoring system that detects  potentially fraudulent transactions or evaluates the creditworthiness of customers. This  system will leverage Apache Kafka for real-time data streaming, a machine learning model  for scoring transactions, and MySQL for storing the results.
