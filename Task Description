The goal of this project is to build a real-time payment scoring system that detects 
potentially fraudulent transactions or evaluates the creditworthiness of customers. This 
system will leverage Apache Kafka for real-time data streaming, a machine learning model 
for scoring transactions, and MySQL for storing the results.



Key Components: 
1. Data Ingestion (Kafka): The system will read payment transaction data from an Apache 
Kafka stream in real time. Kafka serves as a robust, scalable solution for handling highthroughput, real-time data feeds.
2. Transaction Scoring (Machine Learning Model): A pre-trained machine learning model 
will be used to score each transaction based on various features. The model can be 
designed for fraud detection, credit scoring, or other relevant evaluations.
3. Data Storage (MySQL): The scored transactions will be written into a MySQL database. 
This integration ensures that scoring results are immediately available for reporting, 
analysis, and further action.


Implementation Phases: 
1. Setup and Configuration: Install and configure Kafka and MySQL, ensuring they are 
properly integrated with the existing infrastructure.
2. Model Integration: Load and integrate the pre-trained machine learning model into the 
real-time processing pipeline.
3. Real-Time Processing: Develop the Kafka consumer to read transactions, apply the 
scoring model, and write the results to MySQL.
4. Testing and Validation: Thoroughly test the entire system to ensure accuracy, reliability, 
and performance under real-world conditions.
